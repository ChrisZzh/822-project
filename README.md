# 822-project
An exploration in Augmented Reality (AR) 

Author: Weizhao Shao and Zhuohao Zhang
 
In short, this is the repository of an AR project for a course 16822 Geometry Based Methods in Vision. In this project, we explore different ways to do plane extraction and tracking in camera images. Then a virtual 3D object can be projected onto the plane in the camera image. 

This project is currently under development. More exciting content and results will be added soon!
