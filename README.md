# 822-project
An exploration in indoor Augmented Reality (AR) applications 

Author: Weizhao Shao and Zhuohao Zhang
 
This is the repository of an AR project for a course 16822 Geometry Based Methods in Vision. In this project, we are trying to build an AR pipeline used in indoor scenes. The goal for this pipeline is to extract and track planes and project virtual 3D objects onto the planes in camera images. 

We explore different ways to do plane extraction and tracking in camera images. Then a virtual 3D object can be projected onto the plane in the camera image. 

This project is currently under development. More exciting content and results will be added soon!
